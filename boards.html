<h1> UAT Boards for game programming

</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>  
        
            Implement multiple completed games, including 3D games, using common tools, languages and software for web,
            console, PC or mobile platforms.

        </li> 
        <p>
            Think its really cool being able to work on being able to makes and comeplete games including 3d games.
        </p>

        <li>

            Design, develop and implement the architecture and infrastructure needed to support a complete game project. 

        </li>
           <p>
            looking forward to makeing my own game desine and moddles for the game.
           </p>   

        <li>

            Implement and analyze fundamental data structures and algorithms associated with game applications supporting
            gameplay mechanics.
        
        </li>

        <p>
          gameplay mecanics and makeing algorithms that work well with the game all of these are something im exited to learn about.
        </p>

        <li>

            Use software development processes to analyze a project problem and to design, build and test a corresponding software
               solution.

        </li>

        <p>
            Problem solving skills are always good to have and from what I hear with programming is mostly figureing out why something isnt working
        </p>

        <li>

            Demonstrate development skills using multiple programming languages, development environments and platforms,
            including advanced and/or experimental topics in game programming.
        
        </li>
        <p>
            Lerning multiple programming languages will help with getting differnt jobs as they seem to requre you to know the language they use for that project
        </p>
        <li>

            Establish collaboration, mentorship and professional leadership skills by working with other disciplines to deliver highly
            polished and completed projects

        </li>
    </ol>
